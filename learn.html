                <p>According to weforum.org, polar bears, numbering roughly 26,000 in all, are particularly imperiled by
                    climate change as rising temperatures reshape the Arctic landscape and deprive them of their
                    customary sea-ice platform for hunting their main prey, ringed seals and bearded seals</p>

                <p>World Wildlife says that Giant pandas have been allowed to persist only at elevations higher than
                    land that can be used for productive agriculture. However, as the agricultural value of land in
                    current panda habitat increases under a changing climate, activities like growing crops and grazing
                    livestock may further encroach on their habitat.</p>

                <p>The World Bank claims that the connection between climate change and its impact on human wellbeing is
                    increasingly visible. Unchecked, climate change will push up to 130 million people into poverty over
                    the next 10 years—unravelling hard-won development gains—and could cause over 200 million people to
                    migrate within their own countries by 2050.</p>

                <h2>Energy Transition</h2>
                <p>According to S&P global, energy transition refers to the global energy sector’s shift from
                    fossil-based systems of energy production and consumption — including oil, natural gas and coal — to
                    renewable energy sources like wind and solar, as well as lithium-ion batteries.
                    <br><br>

                <p class="p2">Companies like Apple generating 40.73MW of solar energy or Ikea with 35.08MW are now
                    transitioning
                    into greener energy sources.</p>
